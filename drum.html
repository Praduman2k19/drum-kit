       <li><b>How loud is an electronic drum kit?</b><br>
        - Electronic drum pads are quieter, but it depends on the kit you're playing. ... These can be acoustically loud when played and the playing feel for the drummer is not great either. No matter what the kit, stomping on kick drum and hi-hat pedals causes vibration through the floor.</li>

    <li><b>Why are there no drums in classical music?</b><br>
    - So that's the short answer: drums are too easy to play, and drum beats make for too simple of music. You are right that rhythm is usually not that important part of the classical music as for hip-hop or EDM.</li>
